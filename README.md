# RapidMono
Moving my original RapidXNA I created from scratch when working at MS SA into MonoGame

# Fragmented Space
- RapidMonoDesktop

My original game made using my RapidXNA, updated, upgraded, and somewhat rewritten, to show off RapidMono.

# RapidXNA
Originally built Jan 31 2013, under no explicit license, I wanted a nice way to assist my game dev projects in XNA. XNA fell flat, and other engines grew over the years, but to get back into my game dev, for fun, I felt like reviving the original project.
